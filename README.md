# Gugle Slides NO Power Point
Journey through the vines of Pandas groves, untangle the python tails from between the branches, swirl through the storm of a planet giant red, and uncover the national treasure that is Taylor Swift's total google search requests THAT IS between the dates of December 14, 2016 and January 25, 2017. Destiny had traveled down a path of integrated python libraries that combined a crossroads of dataframes, maps, sliders, and Google Trend's API to landmark a dynamic input controlled change over time shader map that displays Googe Trend's search data by country or state. This project was in collaboration with a seperate endeavor to create dynamic racecharts between Google Trend's keywords over time that had been launched [together](https://github.com/Xatnagh/TRENDS-TO-VIDEO) under one very visually appealing webpage(talking twitter extravagance BEFORE 'X') serviced through a python framework and web hosting that reached its trial expiration quite a while ago. This repository revives the python notebook of the map slider feature of the project with the decorated addition of enhanced MANSPLANATION that unsolicitedly holds your hand every step and slide of the way.

# Demo
The magic trick that was supposed to come out this hat does not actually display due to github limitations on dynamic and interactive program outputs by rendering all files as static HTML screens. Enjoy the demonstration of wizardry and my silky pass of the finger over the mousepad in several smooth attemps below as substitute.
